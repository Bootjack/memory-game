# Memory Game
A coding exercise

## The rules
At the beginning of the game, there are some number of cards on the board that are all face down, i.e., their symbol is not visible and all the cards look exactly the same. Card symbols all come in pairs.

In a turn:
- The player turns over one card. The card’s symbol is now visible.
- The player turns over a second card. This card’s symbol is now visible.
- If the two cards’ symbols match, the cards remain face up.
- If the two cards' symbols do not match, the player is given some time to observe them, then they are flipped back over face down.
